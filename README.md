Tracking Emails and Links has never been soo easy !

## b4 critics downpour on me...
#### Why am i using a physical .env file and not os.environ ?
this is just a wip model. i dont want to add environment variables to my pc as i have the exact variables mapped for a diff programme hooked to my compuuter which is very vital. so ya
ps: the final code will be refactored and 100x times better.

#### Why using a encoding system to store all info in the url and not use a dbms in the backend to (i) reduce the url length (ii) prevent others to decode the url.
(a) i just want to avoid issues while hosting.
[to convinc myself] (b) an ordinary joe using gmail or protonmail or some other client is not going to be able to going to find the link eaily. 
(c) an secure algorthm is on its way to fix this concern. 
Also, if i can get to configure the db running serverless, i'd push it instiantly. So till then... patience...


[Edit 1]: me wondering why i posted it here and not on my blog after writing this.
          maybe cause some other cool kids are doing so
